### We have a five groups of numbers:

- the __natural numbers__ N={1,2,3, ...}
- the __integers__ Z={..., -1,0,1,2,3, ...}
- the __rational numbers__ N={a/b:a,b ∈ Z, b != 0}
- the __real numbers__ R encompassing Q as well as irrational numbers like π and √2
- the __complex numbers__ C = {a + bi : a, b ∈ R}, where i ≡ √−1.

### Definition vector space:

___A vector space is a set V closed under addition and scalar multiplication satisfying the following axioms:___

- Additive commutativity (~v + ~w = ~w + ~v) and associativity ((~u + ~v) + ~w = ~u + (~v + ~w))
- Distributivity: For all ~v, ~w ∈ V and a, b ∈ R, a(~v+ ~w) = a~v+a ~w and (a+b)~v = a~v+b~v.
- Additive identity: There exists ~0 ∈ V with ~0 + ~v = ~v for all ~v ∈ V.
- Additive inverse: For all ~v ∈ V, there exists ~w ∈ V with ~v + ~w = ~0.
- Multiplicative identity: For all ~v ∈ V, 1 · ~v = ~v.
- Multiplicative compatibility: For all ~v ∈ V and a, b ∈ R, (ab)~v = a(b~v).
